# Methodology

A Cosmic-Year Synthesis of Science, History, and Revelation

## 1. Purpose of the Artifact

This artifact compresses the entire known history of the universe into a single symbolic calendar year in order to make scale, sequence, and moral responsibility intelligible to the human mind.

It is designed to:

- Help readers feel the disproportion between cosmic time and human history
- Preserve scientific integrity without theological distortion
- Present Qur’anic revelation as authoritative in meaning, not as a substitute for scientific explanation
- Enable teaching, daʿwah, and reflection without polemic or forced concordism

The artifact is not a claim about divine timing. It is a pedagogical lens.

## 2. Cosmic-Year Time Compression

The table uses the following fixed scale:

- 13.8 billion years = 365 days
- 1 day ≈ 37.8 million years
- 1 hour ≈ 1.575 million years
- 1 minute ≈ 26,256 years
- 1 second ≈ 437.6 years

Using this ratio:

- January 1 represents the origin of the universe
- December 31 represents the present moment
- Modern history occupies only the final seconds of the year

This compression is used solely to:

- Clarify proportion
- Emphasize lateness of humanity
- Highlight acceleration of power and responsibility

It is not intended to suggest that revelation encodes scientific durations.

## 3. Domain Boundaries (No Concordism Rule)

This artifact enforces strict separation of explanatory domains:

Science

- Describes what happened in physical reality
- Covers cosmology, astrophysics, geology, biology, archaeology, and history
- Uses mainstream, peer-reviewed consensus only
- Is treated as provisional, revisable, and descriptive

Revelation (Qur’an & Ṣaḥīḥ Hadith)

- Provides meaning, moral framing, and guidance
- Explains why responsibility exists, not how matter behaves
- Is treated as authoritative within its own epistemic domain
- Is never forced to “match” scientific timelines

The artifact explicitly rejects:

- Scientific timestamp extraction from verses
- Claims that the Qur’an encodes modern physics
- Retroactive verse-matching to scientific discoveries

Verses are used for orientation, not technical explanation.

## 4. Chronological Discipline

The table is strictly sequential:

- Earliest events appear first
- No thematic regrouping
- No backtracking
- No narrative rearrangement

Every row represents a unique moment or process in time.

If two events overlap:

- Earlier onset appears first
- Long processes are labeled as such

This ensures internal consistency and auditability.

## 5. Event vs. Process Distinction

Each row is explicitly categorized:

Event
A bounded occurrence with a relatively sharp boundary

Examples:

- Big Bang
- Cambrian explosion
- Dinosaur extinction
- Collapse of an empire

Language used:

- “appears”
- “collapses”
- “is destroyed”
- “begins”

Process
A gradual development spanning long periods

Examples:

- Galaxy formation
- Evolution of photosynthesis
- Spread of agriculture
- Digital age expansion

Language used:

- “gradually spreads”
- “over millennia”
- “develops”
- “expands”

This distinction prevents misleading precision.

## 6. Uncertainty Signaling

Every row explicitly states confidence level:

- Well-established: Strong consensus, multiple independent lines of evidence
- Historically approximate: Broad agreement, fuzzy boundaries
- Archaeologically inferred: Based on material culture and indirect evidence
- Date unknown (Islamic sources silent): Used for prophets and events where revelation provides no dating. This is non-negotiable. Silence is respected, not filled.
This is non-negotiable.

## 7. Qur’an Usage Rules

Each row may contain at most one Qur’an entry, labeled as one of the following:

[Narrative]

- Explicit story or event described in the Qur’an
- Used for prophets, moral episodes, divine actions

[Moral Principle]

- Commands, prohibitions, justice, restraint, gratitude
- Used where human responsibility or misuse of power is central

[Theme / Sign]

- Verses calling for reflection on creation, time, diversity, order
- Explicitly not treated as scientific claims or timestamps

When a verse is thematic:

- It is clearly labeled as such
- It is not tied to a specific scientific mechanism

## 8. Hadith Usage Rules

Only Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī and Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim - No paraphrased or fabricated wording

Each entry includes:

- A short, accurate summary
- The reference number

Hadith are used to:

- Clarify moral responsibility
- Reinforce prophetic narratives
- Never to construct timelines

If no Ṣaḥīḥ hadith applies:

- The cell remains blank

## 9. Prophetic Chronology & Geography

Prophets are listed in traditional Islamic order, without reordering.

Dates:

- Given only as historically approximate when supported by broad scholarly convention
- Otherwise marked “Date unknown (Islamic sources silent)”

Geography:

- Mentioned only when widely accepted or Qur’anically indicated

Examples:

- Mesopotamia (Iraq)
- Levant / Palestine
- Arabia (Makkah)
- Egypt

Specific Pharaohs are not named unless named by the Qur’an.

## 10. Civilization & Collapse Framework

Civilizations are treated as moral case studies, not progress markers.

Included intentionally:

- Rise and collapse cycles
- Environmental stress events
- Knowledge loss and preservation
- Erasure of peoples and cultures

The goal is not nostalgia or triumphalism, but pattern recognition: Power without restraint repeats the same outcomes.

## 11. Modern Era Handling

Modernity is treated as:

- Extremely recent
- Extremely powerful
- Morally unresolved

The table resists:

- Progress mythology
- Technological determinism

Instead, it emphasizes:

- Acceleration of capability
- Expansion of accountability
- Heightened ethical stakes

## 12. Sourcing Method

Expanded Event Description includes in-line source tags

A Source Notes Appendix lists:

- Institution
- Publication or dataset
- Year or standard reference

Sources are:

- Peer-reviewed journals
- Major scientific institutions
- Standard historical reference works

Revelation is cited directly and separately.

## 13. Intentional Limits

This artifact does not:

- Predict the future
- Argue scientific proofs of religion
- Reduce revelation to metaphor
- Claim exhaustive coverage of all history

It is intentionally bounded, disciplined, and auditable.

## 14. Final Principle

The artifact is built on a single guiding principle:

- The universe explains scale.
- Revelation explains responsibility.
- Humanity must live with both.
