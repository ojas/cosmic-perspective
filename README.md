# Cosmic Perspective

These are my working notes on the cosmic perspective — an attempt to read the signs of the universe through science, story, and contemplation.

Contained within is a human-scale map of the universe.

It compresses 13.8 billion years into a single calendar year so we can better understand:

- where we come from
- where we are
- and how brief “now” really is

This is not a belief system. 
It is a lens.

Fork it.  
Adapt it.  
Translate it.  
Make it your own. 

If it helps even one person feel more oriented in the universe, it has done its job.
